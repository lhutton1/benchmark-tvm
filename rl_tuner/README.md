# GA-DQN-Tuner
GA-DQN is a tuner that combines advancements in reinforcement learning and the genetic algorithm tuner that currently exists in TVM. Two independent deep Q-network (DQN)'s are used to suggest where to crossover genes and which detail of a gene to mutate.

To use the GA-DQN tuner TVM (tested with commit d2452502b9486a7993d9dec3d04e449efdd81cf7 only) must be installed in your python environment.

## GA-DQN Tuner debug
A debug version of the tuner is included in order to provide debugging utilities and monitor its learning progress.
